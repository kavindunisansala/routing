# 🎯 FINAL FIX - Quick Test Guide

## What Was Fixed (Commit 5ea7fe3)

**THE REAL BUG:** Array index out of bounds in `RSU_Nodes.Get(index)`

GDB showed the crash at line 116704:
- Code tried to access `RSU_Nodes.Get(1)`, `RSU_Nodes.Get(2)`, `RSU_Nodes.Get(3)`
- But `RSU_Nodes` only had **1 node** (index 0)
- Accessing invalid index → NULL pointer (0x41) → SIGSEGV

**Root cause:** `total_size=28` was hardcoded, but actual nodes = 23 (22 vehicles + 1 RSU)

## ⚡ Quick Test (30 seconds)

```bash
# Get latest fix
cd ~/routing
git pull origin master

# Copy to NS-3
cp routing.cc ~/Downloads/ns-allinone-3.35/ns-3.35/scratch/

# Build and run
cd ~/Downloads/ns-allinone-3.35/ns-3.35
./waf
./waf --run routing
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

You should now see:

```
Network configuration: N_Vehicles=22, N_RSUs=1, total_size=23  ← NEW!
...
HandleReadTwo : Received a Packet of size: 1420 at time 1.036
HandleReadTwo : Received a Packet of size: 272 at time 1.036
Proposed RL started at 1.036  ← Should appear!
Transmitting delta values at 1.036  ← No crash!
HandleReadTwo : Received a Packet ... at time 1.03602  ← Continues!
...
(simulation runs to completion)
```

## ❌ What Should NOT Happen

```
Segmentation fault (core dumped)  ← Should be GONE!
```

## 📊 Two Bugs, Two Fixes

This journey fixed **TWO separate bugs**:

### Bug #1: Division by Zero (Commit f2cf430)
- **Location:** Lines 117989, 118000, 118016, 118021
- **Issue:** Dividing by U[nid] or U[cid] when they're zero
- **Fix:** Added `if (U[nid] > 0.0 && U[cid] > 0.0)` checks
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed but wasn't causing the 1.036s crash

### Bug #2: Array Out of Bounds (Commit 5ea7fe3) ⭐
- **Location:** Lines 92, 139199, 116704, 116681
- **Issue:** Accessing RSU_Nodes[1,2,3] when only index 0 exists
- **Fix:** Made total_size dynamic + added bounds checking
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed - THIS was the actual SIGSEGV at 1.036s!

## 🎉 Expected Behavior Now

1. **Network starts** with correct node count (23 instead of 28)
2. **Packets transmit** at 1.036s
3. **No crash** when accessing RSU nodes
4. **Simulation continues** past 1.036s
5. **Wormhole attack functions** without crashing
6. **Routing algorithm runs** without division errors

## 🐛 If Still Crashing

If you STILL get a crash (unlikely), please run:

```bash
./waf --run "routing" --command-template="gdb --args %s"
run
# After crash:
backtrace
```

And send me the output. But I'm 99.9% confident this is fixed! 🎯
