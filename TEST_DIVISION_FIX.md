# Quick Test Guide for Division by Zero Fix

## üéØ What Was Fixed

**Commit:** f2cf430
**Issue:** SIGSEGV at 1.036s due to division by zero
**Fix:** Added zero-checking before all divisions by U[nid] and U[cid]

## ‚ö° Quick Test (3 minutes)

### In VirtualBox Linux:

```bash
# 1. Get latest code
cd ~/routing
git pull origin master

# 2. Copy to NS-3
cp routing.cc ~/ns-allinone-3.35/ns-3.35/scratch/

# 3. Build
cd ~/ns-allinone-3.35/ns-3.35
./waf

# 4. Run
./waf --run routing
```

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

### Before Fix:
```
HandleReadTwo: Received a Packet of size 1024 bytes from 10.1.50.23 at receiver 10.1.50.7 at time 1.036
HandleReadTwo: Received a Packet of size 1024 bytes from 10.1.50.23 at receiver 10.1.50.7 at time 1.036
Segmentation fault (core dumped)  ‚ùå
```

### After Fix:
```
HandleReadTwo: Received a Packet of size 1024 bytes from 10.1.50.23 at receiver 10.1.50.7 at time 1.036
HandleReadTwo: Received a Packet of size 1024 bytes from 10.1.50.23 at receiver 10.1.50.7 at time 1.036
Proposed RL started at 1.036  ‚úÖ
HandleReadTwo: Received a Packet of size 1024 bytes from 10.1.50.23 at receiver 10.1.50.7 at time 1.03602
... (simulation continues) ‚úÖ
```

**Key difference:** 
- ‚ùå Before: Crash immediately after packets at 1.036s
- ‚úÖ After: "Proposed RL started at 1.036" message appears, simulation continues

## üîç What to Look For

1. **No more SIGSEGV at 1.036s** ‚úÖ
2. **Message "Proposed RL started at 1.036"** appears ‚úÖ
3. **Simulation continues past 1.036s** ‚úÖ
4. **More "HandleReadTwo" messages after 1.036s** ‚úÖ

## üìä Expected Output Pattern

```
... (packets being sent)
HandleReadTwo: Received a Packet ... at time 1.036
HandleReadTwo: Received a Packet ... at time 1.036
Proposed RL started at 1.036  ‚Üê CRITICAL: This line should appear!
HandleReadTwo: Received a Packet ... at time 1.03602  ‚Üê Simulation continues!
HandleReadTwo: Received a Packet ... at time 1.03604
HandleReadTwo: Received a Packet ... at time 1.03606
... (continues until simulation ends)
```

## üêõ If Still Crashing

If you STILL get SIGSEGV after this fix, please run:

```bash
./waf --run "routing" --command-template="gdb --args %s"
```

Then in gdb:
```
(gdb) run
# Wait for crash
(gdb) backtrace
(gdb) print fid
(gdb) print nid
(gdb) print cid
(gdb) print proposed_algo2_output_inst[fid].U[nid]
(gdb) print proposed_algo2_output_inst[fid].U[cid]
```

Send me the output - but I'm 99% confident this fix will work!

## üéâ Why This Fix Works

The crash was a **classic floating point exception**:

1. Wormhole attack reduces link lifetimes at 1.036s
2. Code sets `U[nid] = 0.0` for links below threshold
3. Code then divides by `U[nid]` ‚Üí **Division by zero** ‚Üí FPE ‚Üí SIGSEGV

Now we check `U[nid] > 0.0` before dividing, so:
- If U is zero, skip that condition (no division)
- If U is non-zero, safe to divide

Simple, elegant, bulletproof! üõ°Ô∏è
