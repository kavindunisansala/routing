# Enhanced Blackhole Mitigation - Confirmation Packet Scheme

## üéØ Implementation Complete!

This is a **simplified but effective** implementation of the Confirmation Packet Scheme from the research paper, adapted to work at the application layer without modifying ns-3's AODV protocol.

## Key Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ 1. Test Packet Verification
- Send test packets to verify routes before bulk data
- Wait for confirmation with timeout threshold
- Track test packet success/failure rates

### ‚úÖ 2. Two-Strike Policy
- **First Strike (Warning)**: Node marked as suspicious, given second chance
- **Second Strike (Blacklist)**: Node permanently blacklisted
- Prevents false positives from temporary network issues

### ‚úÖ 3. Blacklist Broadcasting
- Simulates BLACK_PKT broadcasting to all nodes
- Nodes share information about malicious nodes
- Coordinated blacklist updates across network

### ‚úÖ 4. Comprehensive Statistics
- PDR tracking (Packet Delivery Ratio)
- Detection timing analysis
- Strike counts and warning states
- Test packet confirmation rates

## How It Works

### Detection Flow

```
1. Blackhole node drops packet
   ‚Üì
2. Mitigation system detects low PDR
   ‚Üì
3a. First Strike ‚Üí WARNING (Whitelisted)
   ‚Üì wait 2 seconds
   ‚Üì give second chance
   ‚Üì
3b. Second Strike ‚Üí BLACKLIST (Permanent)
   ‚Üì
4. Broadcast BLACK_PKT to all nodes
   ‚Üì
5. Network avoids blacklisted node
```

### Two-Strike Timeline Example

```
Time    Event
------  -----
0.0s    Node 29 becomes blackhole
1.5s    First drops detected (PDR drops to 20%)
1.5s    ‚ö° FIRST STRIKE - Node 29 WARNING
3.5s    üîÑ Second chance given
4.0s    Still dropping packets (PDR now 10%)
4.0s    ‚ùå SECOND STRIKE - Node 29 BLACKLISTED
4.0s    üì° BLACK_PKT broadcasted
```

## Testing the Enhanced System

### Step 1: Pull Latest Code
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/ns-allinone-3.35/ns-3.35/scratch
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kavindunisansala/routing/master/routing.cc -O routing.cc
```

### Step 2: Build
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/ns-allinone-3.35/ns-3.35
./waf build
```

### Step 3: Run with Enhanced Mitigation
```bash
./waf --run "routing \
  --enable_blackhole_attack=true \
  --blackhole_attack_percentage=0.2 \
  --enable_blackhole_mitigation=true \
  --simTime=10" > enhanced_mitigation.log 2>&1
```

### Step 4: Check Results
```bash
# See two-strike policy in action
grep -E "FIRST STRIKE|SECOND STRIKE|BLACKLISTED|Second chance" enhanced_mitigation.log

# View blacklist broadcasting
grep "Broadcasting BLACK_PKT" enhanced_mitigation.log

# Check final statistics
grep -A 20 "ENHANCED BLACKHOLE MITIGATION STATISTICS" enhanced_mitigation.log

# View CSV results
cat blackhole-mitigation-results.csv
```

## Implementation Highlights

### Core Components

**1. Two-Strike Mechanism:**
```cpp
void ApplyTwoStrikePolicy(uint32_t nodeId) {
    if (strikeCount == 0) {
        // First Strike - WARNING
        Mark as whitelisted
        Schedule second chance after 2s
    } else if (strikeCount == 1) {
        // Second Strike - BLACKLIST
        Mark as blacklisted
        Broadcast to all nodes
    }
}
```

**2. Test Packet System:**
```cpp
SendTestPacket() ‚Üí Schedule timeout ‚Üí 
    ReceiveConfirmation() ‚úÖ Route OK
    OR
    TestTimeout() ‚ùå Mark suspicious
```

**3. Blacklist Broadcasting:**
```cpp
BroadcastBlacklistUpdate() ‚Üí 
    Notify all legitimate nodes ‚Üí
    ReceiveBlacklistUpdate() ‚Üí
    Track blacklist reports
```

## Comparison with Research Paper

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features

| Paper Feature | Our Implementation | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Confirmation mechanism** | ‚úÖ PDR monitoring + Test packets | Application-layer instead of RREP-level |
| **Timeout detection** | ‚úÖ 1-2 second timeout | Configurable threshold |
| **Two-strike policy** | ‚úÖ Warning ‚Üí Blacklist | First strike = white-list, second = black-list |
| **Second chance (White_Pkt)** | ‚úÖ 2-second grace period | Automatic after first strike |
| **Broadcasting (Black_Pkt)** | ‚úÖ Simulated broadcast | Pseudo-broadcast to all nodes |
| **PDR evaluation** | ‚úÖ Per-node and overall PDR | Real-time calculation |
| **Detection timing** | ‚úÖ Average detection time | Statistical analysis |

### üîß Simplified Aspects

| Paper Feature | Simplification | Reason |
|--------------|----------------|--------|
| **RREP interception** | Monitor at application layer | Avoids AODV modification |
| **LastHopCount validation** | PDR-based detection | Simpler, equally effective |
| **Explicit Conf_Pkt** | Implicit ACKs/timeouts | Application-layer implementation |
| **Route selection** | Monitor existing routes | No routing protocol changes |

## Configuration Options

### Enable Two-Strike Policy (Default: ON)
```cpp
g_blackholeMitigation->EnableTwoStrikePolicy(true);
```

### Adjust PDR Threshold
```bash
--blackhole_pdr_threshold=0.5    # 50% threshold (default)
--blackhole_pdr_threshold=0.3    # More strict (30%)
--blackhole_pdr_threshold=0.7    # More lenient (70%)
```

### Disable Two-Strike (Direct Blacklisting)
```bash
# In code:
g_blackholeMitigation->EnableTwoStrikePolicy(false);
```

## Evaluation Metrics

### 1. Detection Accuracy
```
Accuracy = Blacklisted Blackholes / Total Blackholes
```

### 2. False Positive Rate
```
FPR = Innocent Nodes Blacklisted / Total Innocent Nodes
```

### 3. Average Detection Time
```
Avg Time = Sum(Detection Times) / Number of Detections
```

### 4. PDR Improvement
```
Improvement = PDR_with_mitigation - PDR_without_mitigation
```

### 5. Warning Effectiveness
```
Warning Rate = Whitelisted Nodes / (Whitelisted + Blacklisted)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Not seeing FIRST STRIKE messages?**
A: Check if two-strike policy is enabled and PDR drops below threshold

**Q: All nodes getting blacklisted immediately?**
A: Lower PDR threshold or disable two-strike policy

**Q: No blacklisting happening?**
A: Increase PDR threshold or reduce minimum packet requirement

**Q: Want faster detection?**
A: Reduce second-chance wait time (currently 2 seconds)
