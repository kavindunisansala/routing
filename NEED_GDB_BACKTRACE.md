# 🔍 Need GDB Backtrace - Crash Still Happening

## Current Status

You successfully:
- ✅ Copied complete file (141,184 lines)
- ✅ Built successfully (no compilation errors)
- ❌ **Still getting SIGSEGV at 1.036s**

This is unexpected because the division-by-zero fixes should have prevented this!

## 🎯 Critical Next Step: Get Exact Crash Location

We need to see **exactly where** the crash is happening. Run this:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/ns-allinone-3.35/ns-3.35
./waf --run "routing" --command-template="gdb --args %s"
```

When gdb starts, type:
```
run
```

After the crash, type these commands:
```
backtrace
frame 0
print fid
print nid  
print cid
info locals
```

**Copy ALL the output** and send it to me.

## 📋 Expected GDB Output Example

```
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007ffff7a1b234 in run_proposed_RL () at ../scratch/routing.cc:118269
118269              overall_quality = ((T_at_controller_inst+fid)->...

(gdb) backtrace
#0  0x00007ffff7a1b234 in run_proposed_RL () at ../scratch/routing.cc:118269
#1  0x00007ffff7a1c567 in some_function () at ../scratch/routing.cc:12345
...

(gdb) frame 0
#0  0x00007ffff7a1b234 in run_proposed_RL () at ../scratch/routing.cc:118269

(gdb) print fid
$1 = 0

(gdb) print nid
$2 = 15

(gdb) print cid
$3 = 7

(gdb) info locals
negation_factor = 0.2
overall_quality = 0
...
```

## 🤔 Possible Causes

Since division-by-zero fix didn't work, the crash could be:

1. **Different crash location** - Not where we fixed
2. **Array out of bounds** - nid, cid, or fid exceeding array size
3. **Null pointer** - One of the controller_inst pointers is NULL
4. **Stack overflow** - Despite recursion limits
5. **Memory corruption** - From earlier in execution

**The GDB backtrace will tell us EXACTLY what's happening!**

## ⚡ Quick Alternative (If GDB too slow)

Add debug output to find crash location:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/ns-allinone-3.35/ns-3.35/scratch
```

Edit routing.cc and add this at line 117898 (start of run_proposed_RL):

```cpp
void run_proposed_RL()
{
	cout<<"Proposed RL started at "<<Now().GetSeconds()<<endl;
	std::cout << "DEBUG: Entering run_proposed_RL, flows=" << flows << std::endl;
	
	for(uint32_t fid=0;fid<2*flows;fid++)
	{
		std::cout << "DEBUG: Processing fid=" << fid << std::endl;
```

And at line 117966 (before DAG conversion):

```cpp
		//convert to directed acyclic graph
		std::cout << "DEBUG: Converting to DAG for fid=" << fid << std::endl;
		for(uint32_t cid=0;cid<total_size;cid++)
		{
			std::cout << "DEBUG: DAG cid=" << cid << std::endl;
```

Then rebuild and run - it will show exactly which fid/cid causes the crash.

**Please run the GDB command above and send the full output!** This will definitively show us what's crashing. 🎯
