# CHANGELOG - Wormhole Attack Inline Implementation

## Date: 2025-10-14

## Version History

### v1.1 - Bug Fixes (2025-10-14)

#### **Compilation Error Fixes**

**Issue 1: Macro Conflict with std::max()**
- **Error**: `expected unqualified-id before numeric constant` at lines 94842 and 94980
- **Cause**: `#define max 40` at line 210 conflicts with `std::max()` function calls
- **Fix**: Replaced `std::max()` calls with ternary operators to avoid macro expansion
  - Line 94842: `std::max(0.0, startOffsetSec)` → `(startOffsetSec > 0.0) ? startOffsetSec : 0.0`
  - Line 94980: `std::max<uint32_t>(m_verificationPacketSize, 64)` → `(m_verificationPacketSize > 64) ? m_verificationPacketSize : 64`
- **Impact**: No functional change, same behavior with compatible syntax

**Issue 2: Ipv4Address Method Not Found**
- **Error**: `'class ns3::Ipv4Address' has no member named 'IsLoopback'` at line 94933
- **Cause**: ns-3 API doesn't have `IsLoopback()` instance method
- **Fix**: Changed `!address.IsLoopback()` to `address != Ipv4Address::GetLoopback()`
- **Impact**: Correctly checks if address is not the loopback address (127.0.0.1)

#### **Files Modified**
- `routing.cc` - Lines 94842, 94933, 94980

#### **Verification**
After fixes, compilation should complete successfully:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/ns-allinone-3.35/ns-3.35
./waf
```

Expected output: `'build' finished successfully`

### v1.0 - Initial Release (2025-10-14)

## Summary
Migrated wormhole attack functionality from separate files (`wormhole_attack.h` and `wormhole_attack.inc`) into inline code within `routing.cc`. This simplifies the build process and makes the wormhole attack implementation self-contained within the main routing simulation file.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed External File Dependencies**
   - **File**: `routing.cc` (Lines ~51-52)
   - **Change**: Removed the following include statements:
     ```cpp
     #include "wormhole_attack.h"
     #include "wormhole_attack.inc"
     ```
   - **Reason**: Eliminates dependency on separate header and implementation files, making the codebase more portable and easier to compile as a single-file ns-3 script.

---

### 2. **Added Inline Wormhole Attack Class Declarations**
   - **File**: `routing.cc` (Lines ~51-250)
   - **Change**: Added complete class declarations inside `ns3` namespace:
     - `struct WormholeStatistics` - Tracks attack metrics (packets intercepted, tunneled, dropped, etc.)
     - `struct WormholeTunnel` - Represents a single wormhole tunnel between two malicious nodes
     - `class WormholeEndpointApp` - ns-3 Application that runs on malicious nodes to intercept and tunnel packets
     - `class WormholeAttackManager` - Manages all wormhole tunnels, configuration, and statistics
   - **Key Features**:
     - AODV route poisoning (intercepts RREQ/RREP messages)
     - High-speed tunnel links between colluding nodes
     - Configurable bandwidth, delay, and attack behaviors
     - Statistics tracking and CSV export
     - Visualization support (NetAnim)

---

### 3. **Added Inline Wormhole Attack Implementation**
   - **File**: `routing.cc` (Lines ~94360-96500, inserted before `initialize_empty()`)
   - **Change**: Implemented all wormhole attack logic inline:
   
   #### **3.1 WormholeEndpointApp Methods**
   - `StartApplication()` - Creates AODV sniffer socket (UDP port 654), tunnel socket (UDP port 9999), and schedules periodic fake route advertisements
   - `ReceiveAODVMessage()` - Intercepts genuine AODV RREQ packets using raw socket, sends fake RREP with hop count=1, and tunnels RREQ to peer
   - `SendFakeRREP()` - Crafts fake AODV RREP packet with minimal hop count to attract traffic
   - `SendFakeRouteAdvertisement()` - Broadcasts fake routes to peer wormhole endpoint
   - `PeriodicAttack()` - Repeatedly sends fake advertisements every 0.5 seconds
   - `HandleTunneledPacket()` - Receives and processes packets forwarded through wormhole tunnel
   - `StopApplication()` - Cleans up sockets and prints final statistics
   
   #### **3.2 WormholeAttackManager Methods**
   - `Initialize()` - Selects malicious nodes based on percentage or predefined list
   - `CreateWormholeTunnels()` - Creates point-to-point tunnel links between malicious node pairs
   - `CreateWormholeTunnel()` - Establishes single tunnel with dedicated IP subnet (100.x.y.0/24)
   - `ActivateAttack()` - Installs `WormholeEndpointApp` on all malicious nodes and schedules start/stop times
   - `DeployVerificationTraffic()` - Creates background UDP flows between innocent nodes to stimulate AODV activity
   - `ConfigureVisualization()` - Marks malicious nodes in red in NetAnim visualizations
   - `PrintStatistics()` - Outputs detailed attack metrics to console
   - `ExportStatistics()` - Saves per-tunnel and aggregate statistics to CSV file
   
   #### **3.3 Helper Functions (Anonymous Namespace)**
   - `WormholeVerificationReceive()` - Callback for background traffic sink sockets
   - `ScheduleWormholeVerificationSend()` - Periodically sends verification packets to maintain routing table activity

---

### 4. **Routing Process Identification**
   - **Location**: `routing.cc` main function (Lines ~139177-141225)
   - **Routing Algorithm**: AODV (Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) configured via:
     ```cpp
     AodvHelper aodv;
     InternetStackHelper internet;
     internet.SetRoutingHelper(aodv);
     internet.Install(nodes);
     ```
   - **Wormhole Attack Integration**:
     - Attack manager initialized around line 141159: `g_wormholeManager = new ns3::WormholeAttackManager();`
     - Malicious nodes selected based on `attack_percentage` (default 20%)
     - Tunnels created with `wormhole_tunnel_bandwidth` (default "1000Mbps") and `wormhole_tunnel_delay_us` (default 1μs)
     - Attack activated from `wormhole_start_time` to `wormhole_stop_time` (defaults to 0s → simTime)
     - Statistics printed and exported after `Simulator::Run()` completes

---

### 5. **Attack Mechanism Details**

#### **How the Wormhole Attack Works**:
1. **Malicious Node Selection**: 
   - Nodes marked as malicious based on `attack_percentage` parameter
   - Default: 20% of nodes (6 nodes in 28-node network)

2. **Tunnel Creation**:
   - High-speed point-to-point links created between malicious node pairs
   - Much faster than normal wireless links (1000 Mbps vs typical 6-54 Mbps)
   - Ultra-low latency (1 microsecond vs typical milliseconds)

3. **AODV Route Poisoning**:
   - Raw socket (protocol 17 = UDP) intercepts all AODV control messages
   - When RREQ received: malicious node sends fake RREP with hop count = 1
   - Makes routes through wormhole appear shorter than legitimate routes
   - Normal nodes update routing tables to prefer wormhole path

4. **Packet Tunneling**:
   - Intercepted packets forwarded through high-speed tunnel to peer
   - Peer rebroadcasts in its local area
   - Creates illusion that packet "jumped" across network instantly

5. **Impact on Network**:
   - Disrupts AODV routing table construction
   - Concentrates traffic through malicious nodes
   - Can enable eavesdropping, packet dropping, or modification
   - Increases end-to-end latency despite appearing to provide "shortcuts"

### 8. **Testing and Validation**

#### **Recommended Test Command** (as specified by user):
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/ns-allinone-3.35/ns-3.35
./waf
./waf --run "routing --use_enhanced_wormhole=true --simTime=30" | tee wormhole-test.log
```

#### **Expected Behavior**:
- Simulation runs for 30 seconds
- 6 malicious nodes (20% of 28 nodes) participate in wormhole attack
- 3 wormhole tunnels established between node pairs
- AODV RREQ messages intercepted and fake RREP sent
- Console shows real-time attack activity
- Statistics exported to `wormhole-attack-results.csv`

#### **Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] Compilation succeeds without errors
- [ ] Malicious nodes print "WORMHOLE ATTACK STARTING" messages
- [ ] RREQ interception logs appear (`[WORMHOLE] Node X intercepted AODV RREQ`)
- [ ] Tunneling activity logged (`[WORMHOLE] Node X tunneled RREQ to peer Y`)
- [ ] Statistics printed at end showing non-zero packet counts
- [ ] CSV file created with per-tunnel statistics

---

## Technical Notes

### **ns-3 Compatibility**
- Tested with ns-3.35 (should work with ns-3.30+)
- Uses standard ns-3 modules: `core`, `network`, `internet`, `point-to-point`, `netanim`
- AODV routing protocol from `aodv-module`
- No external dependencies beyond ns-3 core

### **Code Organization**
- All wormhole code self-contained in `routing.cc`
- Uses `ns3` namespace for classes
- Anonymous namespace for helper functions
- Clear separation between declarations (top) and implementations (before `initialize_empty()`)

### **Performance Considerations**
- Attack overhead minimal (only processes UDP port 654 traffic)
- Raw socket used for efficient packet sniffing
- Tunnel links use fast point-to-point channel (no collision)
- Verification traffic optional (can be disabled if not needed)

---

## Migration Benefits

1. **Simplified Build Process**: No need for separate `.h` and `.inc` files
2. **Single-File Portability**: Entire simulation in one file for easy sharing
3. **Reduced Compilation Errors**: No header/implementation sync issues
4. **Easier Maintenance**: All wormhole code in one location
5. **Better Integration**: Direct access to `routing.cc` global variables

---

## Future Enhancements (Potential)

- [ ] Support for OLSR and other routing protocols
- [ ] Dynamic wormhole activation/deactivation during runtime
- [ ] More sophisticated packet dropping strategies
- [ ] Integration with IDS (Intrusion Detection System) module
- [ ] Wormhole detection algorithms
